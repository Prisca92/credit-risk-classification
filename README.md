Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

1.Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
2.Write a brief report that includes a summary and analysis of the performance of the machine learning models that you used in this homework. 

Report: 

Analysis Overview:

The purpose of this analysis is to create an evaluate a model based on loan risk using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.


Structure your report by using the report template that Starter_Code.zip includes, ensuring that it contains the following:
Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.

The results: 
Machine Learning Model #1:
Accuracy score = 0.99
Precision score = 
(0)= 1.00
(1)=0.85
Recall score =
(0)= 0.99
(1)=0.91

Machine Learning Model #2:
Accuracy score = 0.99
Precision score :
(0)= 1.00
(1)=0.84
Recall score :
(0)= 0.99
(1)=0.99


Summary: 
Two models were generated while conducting this analysis to determine which model fit best. Both models displayed an adaquate fit. However, machine learning model 2 performed best as I noticed more imporevement in regards to accuracy and recall.

Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.
