Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

1.Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
2.Write a brief report that includes a summary and analysis of the performance of the machine learning models that you used in this homework. 

Report: 

Analysis Overview:

The purpose of this analysis is to create an evaluate a model based on loan risk using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.


Structure your report by using the report template that Starter_Code.zip includes, ensuring that it contains the following:
Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.

The results: 
Machine Learning Model #1:
Accuracy score = 
Precision score = 
Recall score =

Machine Learning Model #2:
Accuracy score =
Precision score =
Recall score =

Summary: 

Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.
